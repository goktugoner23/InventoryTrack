# InventoryTrack
 Inventory track program to add it to firebase database

I made this program with React so we can use it as cross-platform.
It is for keeping track of the inventory of our silver-souvenir-gift shop.
Simple UI, but got some work to do yet.
Using a firebase database to add the items to the db and then retrieve them dor monitoring.
